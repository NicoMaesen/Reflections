Lesson 3: Using GitHub to collaborate
--------
  Create GitHub account
  Create a new repository
  add a remote 
    - git remote  --> show all existing remotes
    - git remote add <name> URL-of-GitHub-repository
          ( git remote add origin https://github.com/NicoMaesen/Reflections.git )
    - git remote -v  --> show remote info
  move the local repo to GitHub
    - git push master origin
  get GitHub repo to local repo
    - git pull origin master

  Forking: --> Create a copy of an existing repo on GitHub
  Clone:   --> create a copy of a GitHub repo locally
  branch:  --> create an alternative version of the master to work on locally

  Conflicting collaboration: Changes made locally and on the remote by someone else in the same file can give a conflict
    - git fetch --> get the changes from the remote, this will create a branch locally
    - git merge --> combine the 2 branches into one
    - git pull --> will do a fetch and merge action

  Merging changes together:
    - git pull --> if conflicts are found, they can be found in the file <<<<<  >>>>>  ||||||
        adapt the file and add+commit the file
    - git push --> to sync local and remote.

  merging remote changes - Fast-forward merges
    - git fetch
