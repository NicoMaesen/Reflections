Lesson 2: Creating and Modifying Repositories
--------
  Create a new repository:
    - git init   --> Git will not do a commit initially so git log will give an error (fatal: bad default revision 'HEAD')
    - git status --> to see the status of files in the repo
    - a hidden .git folder is created with git meta data

  Add changes to repository:
    - git add --> adds files to the staging area (git add <filename>)
    - 





What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
